        <p class="basic">Christine Sun is a sophomore at Georgetown University.
          With a major in Science, Technology, and International Affairs,
          Christine seeks to become the bridge between technology and society.
          She’s especially interested in the positive and negative implications
          of emerging technologies.</p>
        <p class="basic">Having spent half of her life in China and the other
          half in the U.S, Christine’s also passionate about U.S-China relations.
          She approaches this topic from a gender angle. Currently, Christine
          is working on an independent project that will remember the Chinese
          #MeToo movement in words.</p>
        <p class="basic">Christine believes in the concept of working for
          what you love. Before she finds her direction, however, she’s
          currently exploring opportunities in product management and consulting.
          She summarizes her reflection about those directions on this website
          for herself and hopefully, for others as well.</p>

        <p class="news-text">When game designer Luke Crane asked a deceptively simple question on Twitter: “Why are there so few lady game creators,” he might not have expected an overflow of responses from women creators themselves.</p>

        <p class="news-text">“Are you coming home this weekend?” “I can’t. I’m busy.” I quickly tapped the letters to reject my mother, but I knew my attempt would fail.</p>
