      <div class="about text col">
        <p class="basic">Christine Sun is a sophomore at Georgetown University.
          With a major in Science, Technology, and International Affairs,
          Christine seeks to become the bridge between technology and society.
          She’s especially interested in the positive and negative implications
          of emerging technologies. Within this arena, she currently dedicates
          her time to a project that analyzes the potential of artificial
          intelligence in various settings.</p>
        <p class="china">Having spent half of her life in China and the other
          half in the U.S, Christine’s also passionate about U.S-China relations.
          She approaches this topic from a gender angle. Currently, Christine
          is working on an independent project that will remember the Chinese
          #MeToo movement in words.</p>
        <p class="product">Christine believes in the concept of working for
          what you love. Before she finds her direction, however, she’s
          currently exploring opportunities in product managing and consulting.
          She summarizes her reflection about those directions on this website
          for herself and hopefully, for others as well.</p>
